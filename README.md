# Financial bank loan analysis using SQL
## Project Overview
The SQL-Based Bank Loan Data Analysis project aims to perform comprehensive analysis and reporting on a dataset containing information about loans issued by a bank. Leveraging SQL queries, the analysis will cover various aspects including customer demographics, loan performence metrics, financial performences.
## Objectives
#### Employee Demographics Analysis:
1. Explore the distribution of employee's based on demographic factors such as loan purpose, loan status
2. Identify patterns and trends in customer profiles.
#### Loan Performance Metrics:
1. Evaluate the overall performance of loans.
2. Calculate metrics such as int rate, installment, and average loan amounts.
#### Time-based Analysis:
1. Conduct a time-series analysis to understand how the loan data has evolved over time.
2. Identify seasonality or trends in loan issuance and repayment.
#### Financial Performance:
1. Assess the financial impact of the loan dataset on the bank.
## Tools and Technologies
Utilize SQL for data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis. Make use of any relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.
## Future Work:
Suggest potential avenues for future SQL-based research or analysis. This could involve exploring additional data sources or refining SQL queries for more in-depth insights.

This project demonstrates the power of SQL in analyzing and deriving insights from a bank loan dataset, offering actionable recommendations for decision-makers in the bank.
